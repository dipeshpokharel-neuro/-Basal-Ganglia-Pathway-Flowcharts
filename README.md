# 🧠 Basal Ganglia Pathway Flowcharts
Direct & Indirect Pathways • Dopamine Modulation • Parkinsonian Circuit Changes

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **clean, editable flowcharts** of the basal ganglia circuitry, including:

- **Direct pathway**
- **Indirect pathway**
- **Dopamine modulation (D1 vs D2 receptors)**
